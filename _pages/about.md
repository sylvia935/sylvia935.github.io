Who I Am
-----

Iâ€™m a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/) at University of Florida, advised by [Kristy Boyer](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/learndialogue/person.php?id=keboyer). I earned my Master's degree in [Information Science](https://sci.pitt.edu/) at University of Pittsburgh, where I worked closely with [Erin Walker](https://www.cs.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/erin-walker/), [Michael Madaio](http://michaelmadaio.com/) and [Amy Ogan](https://www.amyogan.com/) at [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University. I received my Bachelor's degree in Management Science from [Anhui University](http://en.ahu.edu.cn/).

What I Do
-----

My research focuses on Education Technologies and Human-Computer Interaction. I apply human-centered methods to first understand how humans perceive and interact with learning technologies, and then design and implement technology that offers personalized education. 

My research particularly aims to answer a key question: **How can we design learning environments that foster AI learning and provides engaging learning experiences?** Computer-aided learning systems can do more than just present learning concepts and proper pedagogical feedback; they should be able to provide empowering and engaging experiences to learners.
