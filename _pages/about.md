Who I Am
-----

I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/) at University of Florida, advised by [Kristy Boyer](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/learndialogue/person.php?id=keboyer). I earned my Master's degree in [Information Science](https://sci.pitt.edu/) at University of Pittsburgh, where I worked closely with [Erin Walker](http://erinwalker.owlstown.com/) in the Future Adaptive Collaborative Educational Technology (FACET) lab and [Michael Madaio](http://michaelmadaio.com/) and [Amy Ogan](https://www.amyogan.com/) at [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University. I received my bachelor degree from [Anhui University](http://en.ahu.edu.cn/) in Management Science.

What I Do
-----

My research focuses on Education Technologies and Human-Computer Interaction. I apply human-centered methods to first understand how humans perceive and interact with learning technologies, and then design and implement technology that offers personalized education. 

My research particularly aims to answer a key question: **How can we design social, collaborative learning environments to improve student motivation and provide personalized learning experiences?** Computer-aided learning systems can do more than just present proper pedagogical feedback, but be able to provide affective and engaging learning experiences to the users.
