# Who I Am
-----

I am a Research Scientist of Computer Science at [North Carolina State University](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/index.php). At NC State, I work closely with [Tiffany Barnes](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/tmbarnes) and faculty at Digital Transformation of Education (DTE) cluster. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Human-Centered Computing at University of Florida, advised by [Kristy Boyer](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/learndialogue/person.php?id=keboyer). I earned my Master's degree in [Information Science](https://sci.pitt.edu/) at University of Pittsburgh, where I worked closely with [Erin Walker](https://www.cs.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/erin-walker/) and [Amy Ogan](https://www.amyogan.com/) (Carnegie Mellon University). I received my Bachelor's degree in Management Science from [Anhui University](http://en.ahu.edu.cn/).

# What I Do
-----

My research intersects the domains of Human-Computer Interaction, AI in Education, Collaborative Learning, and Computing Education. I use human-centered design methods and artificial intelligence techniques to enhance human learning and cultivate productive collaboration, especially among young learners. 

My research particularly aims to answer a key question: **How can we effectively build learning environments and student modules that foster human learning in computing?** Digital learning systems can do more than just presenting learning concepts and proper pedagogical feedback; they should be able to provide empowering and engaging experiences to learners.
