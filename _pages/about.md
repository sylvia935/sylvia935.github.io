# What I Do
-----

My research intersects the domains of Educational Technologies, Human-Computer Interaction and Collaborative Learning. I focus on pioneering innovative technologies and methodologies to enhance AI education and to cultivate productive collaboration among young learners. 

My research particularly aims to answer a key question: **How can we design learning environments that foster AI learning and provide engaging learning experiences?** Digital learning systems can do more than just presenting learning concepts and proper pedagogical feedback; they should be able to provide empowering and engaging experiences to learners.
